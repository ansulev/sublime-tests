# sublime-keygen

**Pre-built binaries** can be downloaded from [Actions](https://github.com/Antibioticss/sublime-keygen/actions) or [Releases](https://github.com/Antibioticss/sublime-keygen/releases)

## Build

`zig` is required to build this project, version `0.15.2` is recommended

```shell
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```

Then built binaries will be available in the `zig-out` folder

## Usage

**Patch the main executable** (`sublime_text` or `sublime_merge`) before using the generated license!

```plain
$ subkg -h
subkg - sublime products keygen v1.0
Usage: subkg <command> [options]
Commands:
  patch <path>
    (no option needed)
  keygen [options]
    -n <name>      name for the license
    -t <type>      can be: bundle (default), text, merge
    -s <seats>     license seats, pass 0 for unlimited seats (default)
    -i <id>        license id (number)

e.g. (for macOS users)

```shell
subkg patch '/Applications/Sublime Merge.app/Contents/MacOS/sublime_merge'

subkg keygen -n hello -t bundle -i 88888888 -s 1026

# only needed on macOS
codesign -f -s - '/Applications/Sublime Merge.app/Contents/MacOS/sublime_merge'
```

## How does it work

Sublime uses a 1024-bit RSA key to verify the signature of the license, and validates several bytes of the public key SHA-256 hash.

Command `patch` patches the public key and updates the hash bytes in the validation process.

Then command `keygen` generates a license signed with the private key corresponding to the patched public key.

For more details, check the source code `patch.c` and `keygen.c` in [src](https://github.com/Antibioticss/sublime-keygen/tree/main/src)
